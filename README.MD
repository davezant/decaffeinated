It monitors application usage, manages user sessions, and can optionally block websites.

### What it does

- Supports per-user sessions (shared machines)
- Optional website blocking for productivity or parental control

### Where it can be used
- Schools and universities  
- Cybercafés / LAN houses  
- Shared family computers

- Personal productivity setups  

Project is still in early development.
